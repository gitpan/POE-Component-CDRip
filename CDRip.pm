=head1 NAME

POE::Component::CDRip - POE Component for running cdparanoia, a CD ripper.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use POE qw(Component::CDRip);

$cd = POE::Component::CDRip->new(alias => $alias);
$cd->rip(3, "/tmp/03.rip");

$POE::Kernel->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This POE component serves to rip tracks from a CD.  At present it is merely a wrapper for the B<cdparanoia> program which does the bulk of the work.

=head1 METHODS

The module provides an object oriented interface as follows: 

=head2 new

Used to initialise the system and create a module instance.  The following parameters are available:

=item alias

Indicates the name of a session to which module callbacks will be posted.  Default: C<main>.

=item dev

Indicates the device to rip from.  Default: F</dev/cdrom>.

=head2 rip

Used to request that a track be ripped.  The following parameters are required:

=item track-number

Indicates the number of the track to rip, starting with 1.

=item file-name

Provides the name of the file where to store the rip.

    e.g. C<$cdr->rip(3, "/tmp/tst.rip");>

=head1 CALLBACKS

Callbacks are made to the session indicated in the C<spawn()> method.  The names of the functions called back may also be set via the aforementioned method.  The following callbacks are issued:

=head2 status

Fired during processing.  ARG0 is the block number being processed whilst ARG1 represents the percentage of completion expressed as a whole number between 0 and 100.

=head2 done

Fired upon completion of a rip.  The ARG0 parameter contains the name of the file ripped.

=head2 error

Fired on the event of an error.
